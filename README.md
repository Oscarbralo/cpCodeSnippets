cpCodeSnippets
==============

This is a personal project! I don´t use snippets, but I know that a lot of people use them, then I will try to do a little collection of some code snippets that you will be able to use in the contests.

Competitive Programming C# snippets of code ready to import and use in Visual Studio

If you are using C# and Visual Studio 2012, you will be able to copy inside your VSfolder:

..\VC#\Snippets\1033\Visual C#\

And inside here you can copy all the snippets, or you can import them.

Inside VS012, Tools -> Code Snippets Manager and Import.

Still working on them…

Thanks for use
