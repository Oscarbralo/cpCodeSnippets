cpForSquare
===========

This is a little code snippet to use when you need to create a couple of for loops to go through a square.

for(int i = 0; i < $yourStringArray$.Length; i++)
      {
        for(int j = 0; j < $yourStringArray[i]$.Length; j++)
        {
          
        }
      }

The first $yourStringArray$ is to go through the rows.
The second one $yourStringArray[i]$ is to go through the columns.
